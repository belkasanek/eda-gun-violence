# [Kaggle Gun Violence Data](https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data)
The data is about gun-related incidents in the United States from 2013 till 2018 collected by [non-profit organization](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/). I examined general, seasonal and week trends of data. I studied difference between holiday and casual days. I investigated tags associated with incidents and amount of killed and injured people in those incidents. I explored most frequent type of weapons and outcomes of their usage. I found out average outcome for shooters and victims depending on their gender. I built histograms for shooters depending on their age for both genders. I performed analysis on geographical distribution of an incidents on state and city level. I ranked states by density of killed people and dangerous of incidents and checked how their ranks changed in time.
### Main findings:
* The amount of incident increasing about 3.5 thousand each year
* Most frequent type of gun is handguns, but in mass shooting (>=4 dead) part of handguns is decreasing.
* Most shooters age between 20 and 25 then with increasing of age their part is slowly decreasing, but part of young between 15 and 20 also pretty big
* Outcome for shooter is highly depend its gender, female most likely will be unharmed and male will be dead.
* Influence of holidays are different. At Thanksgiving and Christmas there are less incidents and at New Year and 4th of July more compared to casual days.
* There is a lot of incidents in south states, but incidents in west states are more dangerous.
* Big cities have more incidents, especially in Chicago.
* It doesn't seem what any particular state has successful strategy for reduction gun violence.

### Interactive maps
Some of the maps made with [plotly](https://plot.ly/). They can be seen properly through [Nbviewer page](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/belkasanek/kaggle_gun_violence_data/blob/master/gun_violence_eda.ipynb).
